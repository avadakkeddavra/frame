# Custom framework ( like Laravel approach)

To create this product I was inspired by the Laravel framework.

In general, the essence of the framework is the same - to facilitate the developer's life.
The syntax is very similar to Laravel, but there are also some differences.
On the front, you use the template engine Blade, to work with the database included Eloquent ORM

If speak about differences 
The routing system out of routes groups. 
If you want to  use Middlewares you should to decalre it in __construct() of your controller.

For a present day,this frame is far from perfect. 
But even on this stage, It is perfect for developing applications not of high complexity.

It's simple and understandable for every one who ever worked on Laravel

For a future, I'm plannig to expand a functionality to a prowerfull and in the same time very simple system
